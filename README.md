# Sink-The-Startup

GOAL:
Sink all the Startups in the fewest number og guesses. You're given a rating level based on how well you perform.

SET UP:
When the game program is launched, the computer places three Startups, randomly, on the virtual 7x7 grid. When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.

HOW TO PLAY:
The computer will prompt you to enter (a cell), which you'll type at the command line (as "A3", "C1", "B2", etc.). In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line, either "hit", "miss" or "You sunk ".
When you've sent all three Startups to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating ;-)
